# Oncoder: deciphering tumor fractions using circulating cell-free DNA methylation for cancer detection
Oncoder takes cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from human blood as input and predicts tumor components in the blood using deconvolution. In the training stage, Oncoder learns a reference methylation profile from simulated data through supervised learning and applies it to predict tumor components.
